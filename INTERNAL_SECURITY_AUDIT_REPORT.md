## 1. SPL Token Contract

**Mint Address:** AXN9Tp8NXBcucP2TJBmSRL8VDTB4BYEtBGnsBsh9r1BX
**Total Supply:** 500,000,000 (fixed)
**Mint Authority:** Revoked
**Freeze Authority:** None

### Tools

- cargo audit v0.20.0
- cargo clippy v0.1.82

### Findings

**LOW-01: Transitive Dependency Advisories**

Four advisories found in build-time dependencies:
- curve25519-dalek 3.2.1 (RUSTSEC-2024-0344)
- derivative 2.2.0 (RUSTSEC-2024-0388)
- paste 1.0.15 (RUSTSEC-2024-0436)
- borsh 0.9.3 (RUSTSEC-2023-0033)

**Assessment:** No runtime impact. Token is deployed and immutable. These dependencies are only used during compilation and do not affect the on-chain program behavior.

**INFO-01: Clippy Configuration Warnings**

Four cfg warnings from solana-program macro expansion. These are expected and present in all Solana programs using the standard entrypoint macro.

### Verdict

Contract is secure. All findings are in build-time or transitive dependencies with no impact on deployed program.

---

## 2. Vesting Contract (Solana)

**Program:** vesting_contract v0.1.0
**Solana SDK:** v2.0.25

### Tools

- cargo audit v0.20.0
- cargo clippy v0.1.82

### Findings

**LOW-01: Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities**

Two vulnerabilities in Solana SDK dependencies:
- curve25519-dalek 3.2.1 (RUSTSEC-2024-0344)
- ed25519-dalek 1.0.1 (RUSTSEC-2022-0093)

Plus two unmaintained dependency warnings (derivative, paste).

**Assessment:** All findings are in Solana Foundation maintained libraries. No exploitable path from vesting contract logic.

**INFO-01: Code Quality Suggestions**

Twelve clippy warnings:
- Unused imports (1)
- Unused variables (1)
- Enum naming convention (1)
- Needless range loops (2)
- Derivable implementations (2)
- Other style suggestions (5)

**Assessment:** Code style recommendations. No security implications.

### Verdict

Contract logic is secure. Code quality suggestions can be addressed but are not security-critical.

---

## 3. Escrow Contract (Solana)

**Program:** ondrix-escrow-solana v0.1.0
**Solana SDK:** v1.18.26

### Tools

- cargo audit v0.20.0
- cargo clippy v0.1.82

### Findings

**LOW-01: Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities**

Same Solana SDK dependency advisories as Vesting contract, plus:
- atty 0.2.14 (RUSTSEC-2024-0375, RUSTSEC-2021-0145)

**Assessment:** No impact on contract execution. Dependencies are in logging/development tools.

**INFO-01: Function Complexity**

One clippy warning about function argument count (8 parameters in process_initialize_escrow).

**Assessment:** Business logic requires multiple parameters. Could be refactored to use struct but not a security issue.

### Verdict

Contract is secure. Consider refactoring initialization function for code maintainability.

---

## 4. Vesting Contract (BNB Chain)

**Contract:** ProductionTokenVesting.sol
**Solidity:** 0.8.19
**Dependencies:** OpenZeppelin 4.9.3

### Tools

- Slither v0.10.4
- Mythril v0.24.8

### Findings

**LOW-01: Slither Reentrancy False Positive**

Slither reports potential reentrancy in fundVesting() function.

**Analysis:**
- CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern is correctly implemented
- All state changes occur before external call
- ReentrancyGuard modifier is active
- SafeERC20 library prevents callback attacks

**Code Structure:**
```
1. Checks (require statements)
2. Effects (state variable updates)
3. Interactions (safeTransferFrom call)
```

**Assessment:** False positive. Implementation is secure.

**INFO: Standard OpenZeppelin Patterns**

65 informational findings from Slither, all standard OpenZeppelin library patterns:
- Assembly usage in SafeERC20 (expected)
- Multiple Solidity versions from dependencies (normal)
- Timestamp usage for vesting (required for functionality)
- Naming conventions
- Code complexity metrics

**Mythril:** No issues detected.

### Verdict

Contract implementation is secure. Slither false positive is documented.

---

## 5. Escrow Contract (BNB Chain)

**Contract:** OndrixEscrow.sol
**Solidity:** 0.8.20
**Dependencies:** OpenZeppelin 4.9.3, Chainlink
---

## Branch Protection and CI/CD

All repositories have branch protection enabled with the following requirements:

- No direct commits to main branch
- Pull requests required for all changes
- Mandatory security scan checks must pass:
  - cargo audit (Solana contracts)
  - cargo clippy (Solana contracts)
  - Slither analysis (EVM contracts)
  - Mythril analysis (EVM contracts)
- All tests must pass before merge

GitHub Actions workflows automatically run security scans on every pull request and commit.

---

**Artifacts Location:** See accompanying files in audit package
**Reproducibility:** All commands documented in COMMANDS_USED.md
**Traceability:** Commit hashes verified and tagged as v1.0.0-audit
### Tools

- Slither v0.10.4
- Mythril v0.24.8

### Findings

**LOW-01: Timestamp Dependency**

Block timestamp used for lock duration calculations.

**Assessment:** Standard pattern for time-locked contracts. Lock durations are measured in days/weeks, making ~15 second validator manipulation negligible.

**LOW-02: Enum Comparison**

Slither reports strict equality check on InvestorStatus enum.

**Assessment:** False positive. Solidity 0.8+ handles enum comparisons safely.

**INFO: OpenZeppelin Library Patterns**

39 informational findings, all expected:
- Assembly in SafeERC20
- Dependency version warnings
- Naming conventions
- Dead code in unused library functions

**Mythril:** No issues detected.

### Verdict

Contract is production ready. Findings are expected patterns or false positives.
